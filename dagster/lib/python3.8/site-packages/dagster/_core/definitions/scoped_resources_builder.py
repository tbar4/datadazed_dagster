# type: ignore

# NOTE: This file has been factored out from "resource_definition" and type-ignored due to a mypy bug
# when processing dynamically generated namedtuples. This code corrupts the mypy cache and causes
# mypy to fail. When mypy fixes this bug, the type-ignore can be removed and the file contents
# folded back into "resource_definition".
